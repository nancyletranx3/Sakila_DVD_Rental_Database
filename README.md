# Udacity_Sakila_DVD_Rental_Database
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided below.

## Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

## Question 2:
Compare each family movie film with the average rental count for each of the category.

## Question 3:
Write a query to display each of the family movie film, the rental count, and the level of the rental count: 'Bad' if the rental count is less than 10, 'Acceptable' if the rental count is between 10 and 20, 'Good' if the rental count is between 20 and 30, and 'Great' if the rental count is 30 and more.

## Question 4:
Provide the upper quartiles with the movie titles (top 10%) of each category.
